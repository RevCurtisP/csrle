Program installation
====================

1. Edit Makefile and check that the C compiler, install directory etc. are
  correct (they're currently for a Mandrake Linux 10.0 system).

2. Build with

	make

3. Become 'root', and

	make install

Additional files
================

* cis.magic - this file should be added to the end of your "magic" 
  file (often called /usr/share/magic or /etc/magic). You may then 
  need to rebuild it with 'file -C'.
